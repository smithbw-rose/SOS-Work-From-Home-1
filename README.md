# Szünet Slack Bot and Web Application

---

This is a guide to use Szünet Slack Bot in your personal Workspace (hint: this actually doesn't work yet, our bot is not public! More to follow...)

**What is Szünet? And why is the name so weird?**
Szünet is a solution for work-from-home and hybrid offices for taking better breaks and keeping the comradery in the office - even if you're apart. It connects employees through video chat when they want to take a break, and brings them together through an activity that jogs the brain in a subject that isn't work related. The name comes from a Hungarian translation of "break", and we thought it was pretty cool.

*Szünet was created as a part of the Techpoint SOS Challenge (2020). The challenge was initiated by the Techpoint team to fill the gap of lost internships and opportunities for University-level students during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Thanks to Techpoint for giving us the opportunity and resources to build this project!*
